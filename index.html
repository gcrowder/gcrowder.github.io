    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a software developer with data analysis skills who hails from a humanities and legal background. I feel this amalgamation of skills makes me an interesting and capable developer.
        I'm interested in backend web development, data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
        I am currently looking for exciting opportunities in the Research Triangle Area of North Carolina. Please feel free to <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/Crowder_Resume.pdf">download my resume</a> and <a href="{{site.url}}/contact/">contact me</a> for any comments and questions.

        Bringing Buzzwords Home is a three person data visualization project created by myself, <a href="https://github.com/JonathanKross">Jonathan Kross</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/conleydg">David Conley</a> while we were students at <a href="https://www.theironyard.com/locations/durham.html">The Iron Yard</a>.
        We extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) data from disparate sources into relational database, fed visualizations via dynamically created JSON, and created NVD3 visualizations from that JSON. You may view the code for this project on <a href="https://github.com/Bringing-Buzzwords-Home/bringing_buzzwords_home">GitHub</a>.

    <p>
        Tools used include: Git, Django, Django Rest Framework, Postgresql, D3, NVD3 and deployment via Heroku
